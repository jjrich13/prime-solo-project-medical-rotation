# Medical Rotations App

## Introduction
This application was built as a capstone solo project at Prime Digital Academy. This application was built in coordination with Dr. Steve Richardson at the University of Minnesota. Steve Richardson is an anesthesiology resident who, along with his co-residents, is responsible for the education of Medical Students as they undertake their Anesthesia rotation. This application provides medical residents a means to track their students' progress for the 2 week duration of the students' rotation. For students this application provides a means of personalizing their experience and recording accumulated experiece.

## Overview
### For Students

When signing up a student will fill out an intial questionnaire detailing their background, their interests as well as setting goals for themselves to pursue over the next two weeks. The students set goals for the following procedures: 
* Arterial Line
* Central Line
* IV
* Intubation
* Mask Ventilation
* Assessment of ASA Score
* LMA Insertion
* Airway Management

Students will set a numerical goal for each procedure. Each day students will record the progress toward their goals on a feedback form. Additionally students will record which topics they discussed with their resident as well as select topics to discuss with their resident the following day.

### For Residents
Residents will be able to view a summary of all their current active students with a summary of how much progress they have made through their goals. Residents can select a student and see more details about their interests and goals.

Residents can also view a table of all feedback submitted by their students organixzed by date. Each list item displays how much goal progress that student made, as well as the topics of discussion selected for the folliwng day. Individual feedback entries can be clicked on to view the entry in more detail.

### For Administrators

Admins have access to a unique page where they can manage residents, students, discussion topics, and attending physician lists.

## Implementing and Running

1. Clone or download this repository 

2. `npm install`

3. Create a .env file with the following keys: 
```
SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=long random string

EMAIL=functioningEmailAccount
PASSWORD=functioningEmailAccountPassword
```

4. In one command line window `npm run client`

5. In another command line window `npm run server`

6. Create the SQL database `CREATE DATABASE medical_rotations_1`

7. Then setup the structure in the following way:
